# Gemini instructions


## Active English instruction surface

Read [docs/LLM_OPERATING_INSTRUCTIONS.md](docs/LLM_OPERATING_INSTRUCTIONS.md) before acting. It is the normative English entry point for LLMs; the rest of this file supplies project-specific detail.

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first and use [`docs/CLI_COMMANDS.md`](docs/CLI_COMMANDS.md)
for the full Fast capability map.

Run the matching help before every public command:

```bash
simplicio-fast --help
simplicio-fast <command> --help
simplicio-fast changeset <action> --help
simplicio-fast-cross-repo --help
```

Fast provides bounded semantic memory and guarded coordination. Mapper owns
canonical extraction, Dev CLI owns source edits, Runtime owns authorization
and Loop owns convergence. Preserve `schema` fields and never read `.sfast`
offsets or use stale context.

## Mandatory architecture rules for every LLM

These rules apply to analysis, planning, implementation, review, testing, release, and documentation. Read them before acting:

1. **Do not preserve backward compatibility.** Delete obsolete behavior directly; do not add compatibility layers, migrations, or fallbacks.
2. **Choose the simplest implementation that meets the current need.** Do not create speculative abstractions or unnecessary configuration layers.
3. **Build long-lived layers incrementally.** Make the minimum end-to-end version work first, then add capabilities without dismantling working code.
4. **Keep components modular**, with clear responsibilities and explicit boundaries.
5. **Prefer mature, maintained libraries.** Do not rewrite from scratch without an explicit, recorded technical reason.
6. **Inspect existing dependencies first.** Before adding a package or writing a custom solution, check what the project already provides.
7. **Make architecture decisions for the long term.** Do not introduce temporary solutions intended to be replaced later.
8. **Reuse validated patterns from mature products** instead of reinventing them.
