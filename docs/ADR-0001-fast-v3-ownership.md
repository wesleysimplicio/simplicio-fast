# ADR-0001: Fast V3 ownership, engines and execution profiles

- Status: Proposed for implementation
- Date: 2026-07-26
- Issue: https://github.com/wesleysimplicio/simplicio-fast/issues/38
- Parent: https://github.com/wesleysimplicio/simplicio-fast/issues/37

## Context

Simplicio Fast is the semantic CPU/cache engine for repository comprehension and guarded
change delivery. It must keep a project hot across orientation, impact analysis, planning,
editing, validation and retries. The source tree remains authoritative; Fast snapshots are
derived state.

Fast has two maintained implementations:

- **Python**: reference implementation, portable fallback and compatibility path.
- **Rust**: production-preferred implementation for mmap, indexes, concurrency and large
  repositories.

The ecosystem also contains Mapper, Dev CLI, Loop, Runtime, Agent, Code, Sprint, Prompt,
Canvas and distribution packages. Without an explicit ownership matrix, the same component
can accidentally become a second ContextGraph producer, scheduler, policy authority or
mechanical editor.

## Decision

### 1. Fast is the semantic data plane and delivery hot path

Fast owns:

- ingestion orchestration through the Mapper adapter;
- compiled binary/mmap semantic memory;
- immutable base generations and isolated worktree overlays;
- bounded query, context and impact selection;
- generation, source-hash and stale-state guards;
- an internal Understanding IR;
- coordination of the comprehension-to-change pipeline;
- cache reuse, invalidation, leases and refresh;
- provenance, capability and delivery receipts.

Fast does not own:

- cognition, provider choice or final engineering judgment;
- the public canonical ContextGraph;
- mechanical source mutation;
- task scheduling, retries, convergence or PR policy;
- effect authorization, sandbox policy or physical resource governance.

### 2. Canonical owners

| Contract or responsibility | Owner | Fast relationship |
| --- | --- | --- |
| simplicio.context-snapshot/v1 and ContextGraph | Mapper | Fast consumes handles and compiles a derived representation |
| simplicio.fast.snapshot/v* and Generation | Fast | Consumers receive handles; they never read offsets |
| Understanding IR | Fast | Internal to Fast; not a competing public ContextGraph |
| Mechanical Plan/PlanDAG/Changeset | Dev CLI | Fast supplies bounded context and provenance |
| Effect policy, sandbox and physical limits | Runtime | Fast operators run under Runtime in Full mode |
| Attempt, slots, retries and convergence | Loop | Loop pins generations and asks Fast for context |
| Goal, hypothesis and patch strategy | Agent/LLM/coordinator | Fast provides evidence; it does not decide |
| Card/PR delivery workflow | Sprint/Loop | They preserve Fast generation and receipts |
| UX, diagnostics and visual state | Code/Canvas/Desktop | They consume public status/capability contracts |
| Installation/profile composition | simplicio | It bundles Full and Loop-standalone profiles |

### 3. Two supported execution profiles

#### Full

Mapper → Fast → Dev CLI, coordinated by Loop and governed by Runtime.

- Runtime is the sole authority for effects.
- Agent, Code and other coordinators consume Loop/Runtime contracts.
- Fast may use Rust or Python according to the engine router.
- A shell bypass is not allowed when Runtime operators are available.

#### Loop standalone

Loop → Fast → (Mapper adapter + Dev CLI adapter).

- Runtime, Agent and Code are not required dependencies.
- The Loop remains responsible for slots, retries and convergence.
- Fast encapsulates Mapper and Dev CLI integration details.
- Writes use explicit local guards and receipts.
- The same ContextPacket, Generation and Changeset contracts are used as Full mode.

### 4. Engine selection

The public selector is auto|rust|python|off.

- auto: choose Rust only after version, schema, capability, doctor and conformance gates pass.
- rust: require Rust and fail closed; never silently fall back.
- python: force the reference engine and never load Rust.
- off: let the consumer use its previous path when supported.

When Rust is selected, Python Fast modules and subprocesses must not be loaded on the
production fast path. Shadow/dual-run is allowed only in read-only benchmark or canary
experiments and must never apply an effect twice.

### 5. Data and serialization boundaries

- Source files are the only authoritative mutable state.
- Internal persistence uses the versioned binary/mmap representation and the ecosystem's
  HBP/HBI rules.
- JSON is allowed at CLI/API/export boundaries only.
- Consumers use handles, ContextPackets, Changesets and Receipts; they do not parse
  .sfast offsets.
- Every context span carries a source hash; every attempt carries a pinned generation.

### 6. Failure and fallback semantics

A missing, incompatible, corrupt or stale component produces a typed, actionable result.

- No empty ContextGraph is accepted as a successful fallback.
- auto may select Python only with a stable reason code.
- rust fails closed.
- A mutation is never retried in another engine after uncertain effect without an idempotency
  key and state verification.
- A failed refresh leaves the previous complete generation untouched.

## Compatibility matrix

| Consumer | Full mode | Loop standalone | Direct mmap access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mapper | required adapter | encapsulated adapter | forbidden |
| Dev CLI | Runtime-authorized effect | encapsulated guarded effect | forbidden |
| Loop | coordinator | coordinator | forbidden |
| Runtime | policy/effect authority | optional | forbidden |
| Agent/LLM | optional coordinator | optional | forbidden |
| Code/Canvas | optional UX | optional UX | forbidden |

## Required implementation gates

1. Contract fixtures and ownership lint pass.
2. Python and Rust conformance passes for the selected schema.
3. Engine router emits a verifiable selection receipt.
4. Full and Loop-standalone clean installs pass their respective E2Es.
5. Rust promotion has no Python load and no functional regression.
6. Benchmark reports observed results only; unavailable values are null with a reason.
7. Rollback to Python and Fast off is tested before changing the default.

## Consequences

This decision makes Fast central to performance and delivery without making it a monolith.
It preserves Python for portability, gives Rust a clear promotion path, and prevents
responsibility drift across the ecosystem. The price is a shared contract/conformance gate
and explicit profile packaging; those are required for safe speed rather than optional polish.
