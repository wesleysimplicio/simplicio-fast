"""Rust-first Fast engine selection contract (V3 issues #39/#42).

This module is deliberately side-effect free: probing and conformance are supplied
by the caller, so selecting Rust never imports or starts the Python engine in the
same fast path. The CLI/router can persist the returned receipt at its boundary.
